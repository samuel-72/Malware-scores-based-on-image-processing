Malware analysis and classification has become a much harder problem over the last few years, owing primarily to the large number of malware variants being generated by malware writers with the freely accessible tools on the internet. Malware writers have created various clever techniques to thwart traditional static and dynamic analysis methods which are predominantly used in today's anti-virus products. It has become essential to use machine learning techniques that could automatically learn the common features of a malware's variants and use these features for clustering together malware variants of the same family.  In this research, we explore these problems and the claim of image processing techniques to successfully cluster malware variants of different families in real time with a low false positive rate and also look at various feature selection techniques to come up with the most efficient models for detection.
